# 🧾 Block Validator (WIP)

## 🏗️ 1. Overview

In a blockchain, a **validator** is responsible for checking the correctness of blocks before they are added to the chain. This includes verifying that each block:
- Is at the correct height,
- Properly links to the previous block,
- Has a valid digital signature from the block producer,
- And includes only valid transactions.

### ✅ Current Stage
Right now, our validator is implemented as **local code logic**, not a real peer or network participant. It performs basic validation such as:
- Checking block height consistency
- Matching the previous block hash
- Verifying block and transaction signatures

This allows us to build and test the blockchain pipeline incrementally.

### 🚀 Future Implementation
In the full system, a validator will:
- Act as a real network node that receives blocks from peers
- Participate in consensus (e.g., Proof of Stake or other)
- Sign and broadcast validated blocks
- Reject or penalize invalid or malicious inputs from other nodes

This staged approach ensures we can continue development and integration without halting on incomplete network or consensus layers.

## 🔎 2. What a Validator *Should* Do (Theory)

A fully implemented **validator** in a blockchain system is a peer (node) that actively participates in maintaining the correctness, security, and consensus of the network. It should:

### 📥 1. Receive Blocks from Peers
- Validators receive proposed blocks over the network.
- These blocks are submitted by other validators, miners, or block proposers.

### ✅ 2. Verify Block Signature
- Each block must be signed by the node that created it.
- The validator checks the block's `Signature` against the `Validator`'s public key and header data.

### 🔐 3. Verify Each Transaction
- Every transaction in the block must have:
  - A valid signature,
  - Proper data encoding,
  - And (in a complete system) correct nonce, balance, or state root validation.

### 🔗 4. Validate Previous Hash & Height
- Ensure the block's `Height` is `current chain height + 1`.
- Confirm `PrevHash` matches the hash of the previous block's header.

### ⚖️ 5. Enforce Consensus Rules
- Depending on the protocol:
  - **PoW**: Verify that a valid nonce solves the required hash puzzle.
  - **PoS**: Check validator eligibility and stake.
  - **Leader-based (e.g., PBFT)**: Confirm block comes from the designated proposer.

### 📡 6. Broadcast Accepted Blocks
- Once verified, the validator:
  - Adds the block to its local chain,
  - Shares it with other peers for chain sync.

> A validator is not just a checker — it's an active participant in trustless agreement across the network.

## 🧪 3. What’s Implemented So Far

While the full validator is still under development, several core validation steps have already been implemented to ensure basic block correctness. These include:

### 📏 1. Block Height Validation
- The validator checks if the incoming block’s height is exactly one more than the current blockchain height.
```go
if b.Height != v.bc.Height()+1 {
    return fmt.Errorf("block height (%d) is not equal to the current chain height (%d)", b.Height, v.bc.Height()+1)
}
```

### 🔗 2. Previous Hash Check
- The validator fetches the previous header and compares its hash to the incoming block’s PrevHash.

```go
prevHeader, err := v.bc.GetHeader(b.Height - 1)
hash := BlockHasher{}.Hash(prevHeader)
if hash != b.PrevHash {
    return fmt.Errorf("invalid previous hash")
}
```

### 🔐 3. Block Header Signature Verification

- The validator ensures the block was signed by the claimed validator using the HeaderData() method.

```go
if !b.Signature.Verify(b.Validator, b.HeaderData()) {
    return fmt.Errorf("invalid block signature")
}
```

### ✅ 4. Transaction Signature Verification

- Each transaction in the block is individually verified using its embedded public key and signature.

```go
for _, tx := range b.Transactions {
    if err := tx.Verify(); err != nil {
        return err
    }
}
```

### 🚨 5. Basic Error Handling

- Errors are returned early with descriptive messages to aid debugging and unit testing.

> ⚠️ Note: These validations are code-driven and deterministic, not tied to real-time peer gossip or consensus participation. This is an early implementation phase to build confidence before full validator networking and state management.

## 🔍 4. Code Highlights

This section outlines the key areas in the codebase responsible for block validation logic, modular checks, and test verification.

---

### 🧠 `validator.go` — Core Block Validation Logic

The main validation routine resides in the `ValidateBlock()` method:

- Checks for correct block height.
- Compares `PrevHash` against the actual previous block’s hash.
- Calls `block.Verify()` to ensure internal validity (header, signature, transactions).

```go
if b.Height != v.bc.Height()+1 {
    return fmt.Errorf("block height mismatch")
}
prevHeader, err := v.bc.GetHeader(b.Height - 1)
hash := BlockHasher{}.Hash(prevHeader)
if hash != b.PrevHash {
    return fmt.Errorf("invalid previous hash")
}
return b.Verify()
```

### 🧱 block.go — Block Internal Validation

The Verify() method on the Block struct performs:
- Header signature validation (HeaderData()).
- Iterates through transactions and verifies each one.

```go
if !b.Signature.Verify(b.Validator, b.HeaderData()) {
    return fmt.Errorf("invalid block signature")
}
for _, tx := range b.Transactions {
    if err := tx.Verify(); err != nil {
        return err
    }
}
```

### 🧰 Utility Functions
- GetHeader(height) in blockchain.go: Fetches a block’s header by height.
- Header.Bytes() in block.go: Encodes a header to bytes for hashing.
- BlockHasher.Hash(*Header) in hasher.go: Applies SHA-256 to header bytes to generate its hash.

### ✅ Test Coverage

Unit tests cover validator and block correctness under various conditions:
- TestGetHeader and TestAddBlockToHigh in blockchain_test.go check header access and invalid height cases.
- TestVerifyTransaction and randomTxWithSignature() in transaction_test.go verify transaction signature correctness.
- randomBlockWithSignature() used throughout ensures blocks are properly signed for testing.

> 🔎 These tests ensure deterministic correctness of validation logic even before full consensus mechanisms are integrated.

## 🚧 5. Temporary/Simplified Logic (Not Real-World)

This section highlights aspects of the current implementation that are **simplified placeholders** and **not production-grade**, added to keep development progressing.

---

### 🧍 Internal Validator Logic

- Currently, the validator is just **code-based logic** (`ValidateBlock()` in `validator.go`) that checks a block before adding it to the blockchain.
- In real-world systems, this role would be handled by **networked validator nodes**.

---

### 🌐 No Network Layer or Peer Sync

- There's no real **peer-to-peer network**, gossip protocol, or block propagation.
- Blocks are created and added **locally** for simulation and unit testing purposes.

---

### 🔄 No Validator Rotation or Election

- In protocols like PoS or DPoS, validators are **elected**, **rotated**, or **randomly selected**.
- Currently, there's **only one implicit validator**, and no mechanism for validator management.

---

### 📜 No Consensus Rule Enforcement Yet

- There is no **Proof of Work**, **Proof of Stake**, or other consensus algorithm implemented.
- This means **no fork choice rule**, **no difficulty adjustment**, and **no chain selection logic**.

---

> ⚠️ These simplifications are intentional to isolate and verify core data structure logic before introducing distributed consensus and networking.

## 📌 6. What’s Missing (To Be Added)

The current validator logic lays the groundwork, but several **critical components** are still missing for a fully decentralized, secure, and production-ready blockchain. These will be added in future phases:

---

### 🔄 Peer-to-Peer Validation Pipeline

- Incoming blocks should be received from **networked peers**, not generated internally.
- A **validation queue** should handle incoming blocks, verify them, and decide whether to append or reject.

---

### ⚖️ Consensus Mechanisms

- A real-world blockchain must implement consensus — such as **Proof of Work (PoW)**, **Proof of Stake (PoS)**, or **PBFT** — to agree on the canonical chain.
- This will also include **fork resolution** and **finality guarantees**.

---

### 🛡️ Secure Validator Identity & Reputation

- Validators need a secure **cryptographic identity**.
- Systems like **staking**, **reputation scoring**, or **validator whitelisting** will eventually govern who can propose/validate blocks.

---

### 🌐 Block Propagation and Gossiping

- Blocks must be **broadcast** to peers via a **gossip protocol**.
- This ensures fast dissemination and **convergence** across the network.

---

### ⚔️ Slashing for Invalid Blocks (Future)

- Validators who propose or sign **invalid blocks** should face consequences (e.g., **slashing**, **blacklisting**, or **stake forfeiture**).
- This discourages malicious behavior and enforces honest validation.

---

> 🧩 These features are essential to make the validator part of a **trustless, distributed, and secure** blockchain ecosystem.

# üìò Key Pairs and Digital Signatures in Go

## 1. Introduction

In any blockchain system or cryptographic application, the foundation of trust and security lies in the use of **cryptographic key pairs** and **digital signatures**. These mechanisms ensure that data is authentic, unaltered, and comes from a verified source.

This guide explores how to generate and use key pairs in Go using the `crypto/ecdsa` package, specifically with **Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)**. We'll learn how to:

- Generate private and public keys.
- Derive an address from a public key.
- Create and verify digital signatures.
- Understand the mathematical foundation of ECDSA.
- Write thorough tests to confirm the security properties.

We‚Äôll implement all of this step by step, building our own `crypto` package that handles key generation, signing, and verification ‚Äî just like you‚Äôd see in a blockchain system such as Ethereum or Bitcoin.

By the end of this guide, you‚Äôll have an end-to-end understanding of how cryptographic identity works and how it‚Äôs programmatically achieved in Go.

## 2. Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) Basics

Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is a form of public-key cryptography based on the algebraic structure of elliptic curves over finite fields. Compared to traditional algorithms like RSA, ECC offers the same level of security with much smaller key sizes, making it ideal for blockchains, secure messaging, and embedded systems.

### What is an Elliptic Curve?

An elliptic curve over a finite field is defined by an equation of the form:

$$
y^2 = x^3 + ax + b \pmod{p}
$$

where:
- `a` and `b` are constants,
- `p` is a large prime number defining the finite field.

Only points that satisfy this equation (x, y) within the finite field are valid points on the curve.

### Why ECC?

- **Smaller keys**: ECC provides strong security with shorter key lengths. For example, a 256-bit ECC key is roughly equivalent to a 3072-bit RSA key.
- **Efficiency**: Faster computations, especially for signing and verifying messages.
- **Security**: Based on the hardness of the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP), which is currently computationally infeasible to solve.

### What is ECDSA?

ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) is the elliptic curve variant of the Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA). It allows us to:

- Generate a key pair (private and public keys)
- Sign arbitrary messages using the private key
- Verify signatures using the public key

We will use the `P-256` curve (also known as `secp256r1`) provided by Go's standard library:

```go
import "crypto/elliptic"

elliptic.P256()
```

This is a widely used NIST-recommended curve, suitable for secure applications.

## 3. Generating Key Pairs

### 3.1 `PrivateKey` Struct and Generation

To generate a key pair, we first define our own `PrivateKey` struct that wraps around Go‚Äôs standard `ecdsa.PrivateKey`. This allows us to build custom methods on top of it and keep our crypto logic modular.

Here‚Äôs the code for our struct and key generation function:

```go
package crypto

import (
	"crypto/ecdsa"
	"crypto/elliptic"
	"crypto/rand"
)

type PrivateKey struct {
	key *ecdsa.PrivateKey
}

func GeneratePrivateKey() PrivateKey {
	key, err := ecdsa.GenerateKey(elliptic.P256(), rand.Reader)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	return PrivateKey{
		key: key,
	}
}
```

üîç Explanation

- ecdsa.GenerateKey is a standard library function that generates an ECDSA private key using the P-256 elliptic curve and a secure random number generator.
- We wrap the result inside our PrivateKey type for better encapsulation and future extensibility.
- elliptic.P256() is the specific elliptic curve we‚Äôre using ‚Äî a 256-bit NIST-recommended curve (secp256r1).
- If key generation fails (which is very rare), we panic to immediately surface the issue during development or testing.

This PrivateKey struct will now act as the central holder of our cryptographic identity. In the next section, we‚Äôll derive the corresponding public key from this private key.

### 3.2 Getting the Corresponding `PublicKey`

Once we have the private key, we need to obtain its corresponding public key. The public key is mathematically derived from the private key on the elliptic curve and can be freely shared without compromising security.

Here is the `PublicKey` struct and a method to extract the public key from a private key:

```go
type PublicKey struct {
	key *ecdsa.PublicKey
}

func (k PrivateKey) PublicKey() PublicKey {
	return PublicKey{
		key: &k.key.PublicKey,
	}
}
```

üîç Explanation
- The PublicKey struct wraps Go‚Äôs standard ecdsa.PublicKey.
- The PublicKey() method on the PrivateKey type returns the associated PublicKey.
- Internally, ecdsa.PrivateKey contains a public key as key.PublicKey, which we simply reference.
- This ensures a clear and safe separation between private and public components.

This method enables us to safely retrieve and distribute the public key while keeping the private key secret.

In the following sections, we will see how to use this public key to derive addresses and verify digital signatures.


## 4. Address Derivation

### 4.1 What is an Address?

In blockchain systems, an **address** is a compact and user-friendly identifier derived from a public key. It acts as a pseudonymous identity that can receive and send transactions. Instead of using the full public key (which may be large and verbose), we generate a shorter fixed-size representation called an address.

While blockchains differ in how addresses are computed, a common method is to:
1. Derive the public key from the private key.
2. Hash the public key using a cryptographic hash function (e.g., SHA-256 followed by RIPEMD-160).
3. Take a fixed number of bytes (e.g., 20 bytes) to form the address.

In our implementation, we‚Äôve defined a fixed-size `Address` type:

```go
type Address [20]byte
```
We also defined a helper function to convert a byte slice into an Address:

```go
func AddressFromBytes(b []byte) Address {
	if len(b) != 20 {
		panic("Address must be 20 bytes")
	}

	var a Address
	for i := 0; i < 20; i++ {
		a[i] = b[i]
	}
	return a
}
```

And for convenient string representation (e.g., when printing or logging), we implemented the String() method:

```go
func (a Address) String() string {
	return hex.EncodeToString(a.ToSlice())
}
```

This ensures our address can be displayed in hexadecimal form, which is a common format for blockchain addresses.

### 4.2 How to Convert a Public Key into an Address

To derive an address from a public key, we follow a standard cryptographic approach inspired by how blockchains like Ethereum and Bitcoin handle it. The process typically involves hashing the public key and then truncating or processing the result to form a shorter identifier.

In our case, we hash the public key and extract the last 20 bytes to use as the address:

```go
func (k PublicKey) Address() Address {
	pubKeyBytes := elliptic.Marshal(elliptic.P256(), k.key.X, k.key.Y)
	hash := sha256.Sum256(pubKeyBytes)

	// Take the last 20 bytes of the SHA-256 hash
	return AddressFromBytes(hash[len(hash)-20:])
}
```

üîç Explanation

- elliptic.Marshal(...) encodes the public key (X, Y) point into a byte slice. This is necessary because elliptic curve public keys are points on a 2D curve.
- We then apply sha256.Sum256 to the marshaled bytes. This ensures the key is hashed cryptographically and uniformly.
- Finally, we take the last 20 bytes of the 32-byte SHA-256 hash to construct our address using the AddressFromBytes helper.
- This approach mimics Ethereum‚Äôs style of addressing (which takes the last 20 bytes of a Keccak-256 hash), but here we use SHA-256 for simplicity and compatibility with Go‚Äôs standard libraries.

This method gives us a consistent, fixed-length address that uniquely maps to the given public key and can be safely shared or stored.

With this in place, we now have full support for generating key pairs and deriving addresses. Next, we‚Äôll dive into cryptographic signatures.

## 5. Digital Signatures

### 5.1 What is a Signature?

A **digital signature** is a cryptographic proof that a given message was signed by the holder of a specific private key ‚Äî and has not been tampered with. Signatures ensure **authenticity** (the message comes from the claimed source) and **integrity** (the message hasn't been altered).

In the context of elliptic curve cryptography (ECC), and more specifically ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm), a signature is composed of two large integers: `r` and `s`.

Here‚Äôs a mathematical overview of how a digital signature works in ECC:

#### üìê ECDSA Signing Steps (Simplified)

Given:
- A private key `d`
- A message hash `z`

1. Choose a random number `k` from [1, n‚àí1], where `n` is the order of the curve.
2. Compute the elliptic curve point:  
   `R = k * G`, where `G` is the base point of the curve.
3. Let `r = R.x mod n`. If `r == 0`, start over with a new `k`.
4. Compute:  
   `s = k‚Åª¬π (z + r * d) mod n`. If `s == 0`, start over.
5. The signature is the pair `(r, s)`.

Anyone with the public key can later verify the signature `(r, s)` matches the message and the signer‚Äôs key.

In our Go code, we implement the `Signature` struct and the `Sign()` function like this:

```go
type Signature struct {
	r, s *big.Int
}

func (k PrivateKey) Sign(data []byte) (*Signature, error) {
	r, s, err := ecdsa.Sign(rand.Reader, k.key, data)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}
	return &Signature{r, s}, nil
}
```

- ecdsa.Sign(...) uses Go‚Äôs standard crypto library to perform all the above ECDSA steps under the hood.
- The data parameter should ideally be a cryptographic hash of the message (e.g., SHA-256 of the message), though for simplicity we pass the raw message here.
- The resulting signature can be verified later using the corresponding public key.

### 5.2 Signing a Message

To ensure message authenticity, we allow a private key to "sign" data. This operation generates a digital signature that others can verify using the corresponding public key.

In your implementation, signing is handled through a method on the `PrivateKey` type:

```go
func (k PrivateKey) Sign(data []byte) (*Signature, error) {
	r, s, err := ecdsa.Sign(rand.Reader, k.key, data)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	return &Signature{r, s}, nil
}
```

üîç How It Works
- Input: A message in the form of a byte slice []byte.
- Operation: Internally, the ecdsa.Sign function:
- Randomly generates a number k.
- Computes a point R = k * G on the elliptic curve.
- Calculates the values r and s using your private key and message hash.
- Output: A Signature struct holding two big integers r and s.

üõ°Ô∏è Our Signature Struct

We defined the signature struct as:

```go
type Signature struct {
	r, s *big.Int
}
```

This matches the mathematical format of ECDSA signatures, where the (r, s) pair can later be used to verify the authenticity of the signed message.

> **Note:** In real-world use cases, you‚Äôd usually hash the data before signing it to ensure fixed-length input and avoid signing raw or overly long data. However, for simplicity and clarity, you‚Äôre signing the message bytes directly ‚Äî which works fine in most test environments.

### 5.3 Verifying a Signature

After signing a message, it is important to verify that the signature is valid and that it was indeed created by the holder of the corresponding private key.

The signature verification logic is implemented using a method on the `Signature` struct:

```go
func (sig Signature) Verify(pubKey PublicKey, data []byte) bool {
	return ecdsa.Verify(pubKey.key, data, sig.r, sig.s)
}
```

‚úÖ Explanation
- ecdsa.Verify checks whether the (r, s) values (stored in the Signature struct) form a valid signature for the provided message data using the specified public key.
- The method returns true if the signature is valid, and false otherwise.

üß™ Testing the Verification Logic

We created unit tests to confirm the correctness of the signing and verification flow.

`Test: Successful Verification`

```go
func TestKeyPair_Sign_Verify_Success(t *testing.T) {
	privKey := GeneratePrivateKey()
	pubKey := privKey.PublicKey()

	msg := []byte("Hello, Blockchainz!")
	sig, err := privKey.Sign(msg)
	assert.Nil(t, err)

	assert.True(t, sig.Verify(pubKey, msg), "Signature verification failed")
}
```

This test ensures that a valid signature generated using a private key can be successfully verified using its corresponding public key.

`Test: Failed Verification`

```go
func TestKeyPair_Sign_Verify_Fail(t *testing.T) {
	privKey := GeneratePrivateKey()
	msg := []byte("Hello, Blockchainz!")
	sig, err := privKey.Sign(msg)
	assert.Nil(t, err)

	attackPrivKey := GeneratePrivateKey()
	attackPubKey := attackPrivKey.PublicKey()

	assert.False(t, sig.Verify(attackPubKey, msg), "Attack successfully verified a signature that should not match")
	assert.False(t, sig.Verify(privKey.PublicKey(), []byte("Tampered message")), "Signature verification should fail for tampered message")
}
```

This test ensures that:
- A signature cannot be verified with a different public key.
- A valid signature becomes invalid if the original message is tampered with.

By following the ECDSA standard and applying it with the Go `crypto/ecdsa` library, we achieve the following goals:

- **Authenticity**: Only the holder of the private key can generate a valid signature.
- **Integrity**: Any modification to the original message invalidates the signature.
- **Non-repudiation**: Since only one party holds the private key, it cannot deny having signed the message.

In this implementation, signatures are created and verified directly using the message bytes. For production environments, it is recommended to hash the data before signing to ensure a fixed-length input and improve performance and security.

## 6. Mathematical Overview of ECDSA (Optional)
</summary>

### 6.1 How ECDSA Works (Brief)

Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) is a cryptographic scheme based on elliptic curve mathematics used to generate and verify digital signatures.

#### Signing Process

Given a private key \( d \) and a message \( m \), the signing involves the following steps:

1. Compute the hash of the message:  
   \[
   z = \text{HASH}(m)
   \]

2. Select a random integer \( k \) from the interval \([1, n-1]\), where \( n \) is the order of the elliptic curve base point \( G \).

3. Compute the elliptic curve point:
   \[
   (x_1, y_1) = k \times G
   \]

4. Compute:
   \[
   r = x_1 \mod n
   \]
   If \( r = 0 \), select a new \( k \) and repeat.

5. Compute:
   \[
   s = k^{-1}(z + r \cdot d) \mod n
   \]
   If \( s = 0 \), select a new \( k \) and repeat.

6. The signature is the pair \( (r, s) \).

#### Verification Process

Given the public key \( Q = d \times G \), the signature \( (r, s) \), and the message \( m \):

1. Check that \( r \) and \( s \) are integers in the interval \([1, n-1]\).

2. Compute the hash of the message:
   \[
   z = \text{HASH}(m)
   \]

3. Compute:
   \[
   w = s^{-1} \mod n
   \]

4. Compute:
   \[
   u_1 = z \cdot w \mod n
   \]
   \[
   u_2 = r \cdot w \mod n
   \]

5. Compute the elliptic curve point:
   \[
   (x_2, y_2) = u_1 \times G + u_2 \times Q
   \]

6. The signature is valid if:
   \[
   r \equiv x_2 \mod n
   \]

#### Summary

- The private key \( d \) is used to generate the signature \( (r, s) \).
- The public key \( Q \) is used to verify the signature against the message.
- Security relies on the difficulty of the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem.
- The random value \( k \) must be unique per signature to ensure security.

This mathematical foundation underpins the Go `crypto/ecdsa` library functions used for signing and verification in this guide.

# 📘 Guide 6: The Blockchain Data Structure

## 📖 1. Blockchain as a State Machine (Our Implementation)

In our implementation, the blockchain is modeled as a **state machine** where each valid block represents a transition from one state to the next. The `Blockchain` struct is responsible for managing the current state, validating incoming blocks, and updating internal indexes.

```go
type Blockchain struct {
	store     Storage
	headers   []*Header
	validator Validator
}
```

- store is a pluggable component that handles how blocks are persisted (in memory for now).
- headers is a slice that maintains the chain of block headers, effectively representing the blockchain’s height and historical structure.
- validator is a modular interface that ensures new blocks follow consensus rules before being added.

Each time a block is added, it modifies the internal state of the blockchain — namely, the headers slice and underlying store.

> 📝 Note: At this stage, only headers are tracked in memory. Full block indexing and richer state tracking (e.g., balances, UTXOs, smart contract state) will be added in future stages.

## 🔗 2. Blocks, Headers, and Chain Linking

Each `Block` in the chain contains a `Header`, a list of `Transaction`s, and validator metadata (public key and signature). The `Header` stores minimal metadata required to maintain the chain and link blocks securely.

```go
type Block struct {
	Header       *Header
	Transactions []Transaction
	Validator    crypto.PublicKey
	Signature    *crypto.Signature
}
```

### 🔹 Header Structure

```go
type Header struct {
	Version   uint32
	PrevHash  types.Hash
	Timestamp uint64
	Height    uint32
	Nonce     uint64
}
```

- PrevHash links the block to its predecessor, forming the core of the blockchain.
- Height ensures every block has a unique position in the chain.
- Timestamp, Nonce, and Version support future consensus rules (like proof-of-work, etc.).

> ⚠️ Note: Currently, our implementation does not validate the correctness of PrevHash. This will be added in a future step to enforce proper chaining and prevent forks or malformed chains.

The combination of header metadata and validator signature ensures that each block is:
- Authenticated (signed by the validator),
- Ordered (via height),
- Linked (via PrevHash),
- Immutable (via hashing).

## 🌱 3. Genesis Block Initialization

Every blockchain starts from a **genesis block**, which serves as the root of the chain. It is the only block that is not linked to a previous block and is manually injected into the chain.

In our implementation, the `NewBlockchain` constructor accepts a `*Block` (the genesis block) and initializes the internal state:

```go
func NewBlockchain(genesis *Block) (*Blockchain, error) {
	bc := &Blockchain{
		headers: []*Header{},
		store: NewMemoryStorage(),
	}
	bc.validator = NewBlockValidator(bc)
	err := bc.addBlockWithoutValidation(genesis)
	return bc, err
}
```

- The genesis block is added without validation, since there are no previous blocks to check against.
- The headers slice is updated with the genesis block’s header.
- The store is initialized to keep future blocks in memory.

> 📝 Note: While the genesis block is trusted and added unconditionally, future blocks must pass full validation (e.g., signature and height checks).

## 🧱 4. Adding and Validating Blocks

Blocks are added to the blockchain using the `AddBlock` method, which ensures that every block passes validation before being stored and indexed:

```go
func (bc *Blockchain) AddBlock(b *Block) error {
	if err := bc.validator.ValidateBlock(b); err != nil {
		return err
	}
	return bc.addBlockWithoutValidation(b)
}
```

### ✅ Validation Process

Validation is delegated to a Validator interface. The default BlockValidator performs:

1.	Duplicate Height Check:
Ensures a block with the same height hasn’t already been added:

```go
if v.bc.HasBlock(b.Height) {
    return fmt.Errorf("chain already contains block")
}
```

2.	Signature Verification:
Ensures the block has a valid cryptographic signature:

```go
if err := b.Verify(); err != nil {
    return err
}
```

> ⚠️ Note: The PrevHash linkage between blocks is currently not checked during validation. This will be enforced in a future update to ensure strict parent-child linkage.

### 🧠 Internal Append Logic

If the block is valid, addBlockWithoutValidation is called, which updates:
- The in-memory list of headers:

```go
bc.headers = append(bc.headers, b.Header)
```

- The storage backend via:

```go
bc.store.Put(b)
```

This two-phase process separates validation from storage and indexing, making it easy to test, extend, and adapt to future consensus rules.

## 🧪 5. Validator Interface and Rules

Validation logic is abstracted using a `Validator` interface. This makes it easy to swap out or extend block validation logic as the blockchain evolves.

```go
type Validator interface {
	ValidateBlock(*Block) error
}
```

### ✅ BlockValidator Implementation

The default validator is BlockValidator, which is tightly coupled to the Blockchain instance to access chain state.

```go
type BlockValidator struct {
	bc *Blockchain
}
```

The core method:

```go
func (v *BlockValidator) ValidateBlock(b *Block) error {
	if v.bc.HasBlock(b.Height) {
		return fmt.Errorf("chain already contains block (%d)", b.Height)
	}
	if err := b.Verify(); err != nil {
		return err
	}
	return nil
}
```

🔍 What It Checks
- `Duplicate Height:` Prevents two blocks from occupying the same position.
- `Digital Signature:` Verifies that the block is signed by the declared validator.

> 🔧 Pluggable Design: You can swap in a new validator using:
>```go
>bc.SetValidator(customValidator)

> ⚠️ Note: The validator does not yet check whether PrevHash correctly points to the hash of the previous block. This check will be added to enforce correct block ordering and parent linkage.

## 🗃️ 6. Storage Abstraction

Block persistence is handled through the `Storage` interface, which allows flexible implementations such as in-memory, file-based, or database-backed storage.

```go
type Storage interface {
	Put(*Block) error
}
```

### 🧪 Current Implementation: MemoryStorage

For testing and rapid development, an in-memory storage backend is used:

```go
type MemoryStorage struct {}

func (s *MemoryStorage) Put(b *Block) error {
	return nil
}
```

Although this implementation is a stub (doesn’t actually store blocks yet), it establishes the interface required by the Blockchain.

> ⚠️ Note: In the current version, only headers are stored and tracked. Full block persistence (and block retrieval by height/hash) will be added in a future update.

### 📦 Usage in Blockchain

```go
bc := &Blockchain{
	headers: []*Header{},
	store:   NewMemoryStorage(),
}
```

- Abstracting Storage enables future integration with disk-based or distributed storage.
- It keeps the blockchain logic clean and testable without hard-coding a storage backend.

## 📏 7. Indexing: Chain Height and Header Tracking

To track the position and continuity of blocks in the chain, our blockchain maintains a list of block headers:

```go
type Blockchain struct {
	headers []*Header
}
```

Each time a valid block is added, its header is appended to this slice:

```go
func (bc *Blockchain) addBlockWithoutValidation(b *Block) error {
	bc.headers = append(bc.headers, b.Header)
	return bc.store.Put(b)
}
```

### 📐 Key Indexing Functions

- `Height()`
Returns the current height of the blockchain:

```go
func (bc *Blockchain) Height() uint32 {
    return uint32(len(bc.headers) - 1)
}
```

- `HasBlock(height uint32)`
Checks if a block at a specific height exists:

```go
func (bc *Blockchain) HasBlock(height uint32) bool {
    return height <= bc.Height()
}
```

This indexing model supports fast lookup and clear tracking of the chain’s progression.

> ⚠️ Note: Currently, headers are the only part of the block being indexed and tracked. A future update may introduce richer indexing structures for full blocks, transactions, and state snapshots.

## ✅ 9. Testing the Blockchain

Extensive tests ensure that block addition, validation, indexing, and rejection rules behave as expected. These tests use Go’s `testing` package along with `testify/assert` for clarity and precision.

### 🧪 `TestBlockchain`

Verifies initialization:

- Genesis block is added correctly.
- Validator is set.
- Initial height is 0.

```go
func TestBlockchain(t *testing.T) {
	bc, err := NewBlockchain(randomBlock(0))
	assert.Nil(t, err)
	assert.NotNil(t, bc.validator)
	assert.Equal(t, bc.Height(), uint32(0))
}
```

### 🧪 TestHasBlock

Confirms that blocks can be looked up by height:

```go
func TestHasBlock(t *testing.T) {
	bc := newBlockchainWithGenesis(t)
	assert.True(t, bc.HasBlock(0))
}
```

### 🧪 TestAddBlock

Adds 100 blocks with valid signatures and confirms:
- No validation errors.
- Blockchain height is updated.
- Duplicate block at height 98 is rejected.

```go
func TestAddBlock(t *testing.T) {
	bc := newBlockchainWithGenesis(t)

	for i := 0; i < 100; i++ {
		block := randomBlockWithSignature(t, uint32(i+1))
		err := bc.AddBlock(block)
		assert.Nil(t, err)
	}

	assert.Equal(t, bc.Height(), uint32(100))
	assert.Equal(t, len(bc.headers), 101)

	// Attempt to re-add a block at existing height
	err := bc.AddBlock(randomBlockWithSignature(t, 98))
	assert.NotNil(t, err) // should fail due to duplicate height
}
```

These tests verify:
- Chain growth is correct.
- Validation logic works.
- Invalid blocks (e.g., wrong signature or duplicate height) are properly rejected.

> 🧪 Note: As PrevHash checking is not yet implemented, tests for incorrect PrevHash are not present. These will be included in a future validation layer.

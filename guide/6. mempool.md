# 🧠 Mempool (TxPool) Guide

## 🏗️ 1. Overview

In a blockchain system, the **mempool** (short for memory pool) is a crucial component that temporarily holds all pending transactions before they are included in a block. It acts as a staging area where new transactions wait for validation and inclusion by block producers or validators.

### 🧾 Why We Need a Mempool

- **Pre-Block Staging:** Transactions do not get written to the blockchain immediately. They must first be verified, held temporarily, and then selected for inclusion in a block.
- **Deduplication & Validation:** It prevents duplicate transactions from being processed and helps enforce signature and format correctness.
- **Selection & Prioritization:** Block producers (or miners/validators) can select transactions from the mempool based on policies like age, fee, or gas usage.
- **Peer Propagation:** In a full P2P implementation, the mempool would also be where transactions received from peers are stored before rebroadcasting or block inclusion.

### 🧪 Current Stage of Implementation (Code-Based)

In your project, the mempool is implemented as a simple in-memory structure called `TxPool`. Here's what's implemented so far:

- ✅ Transaction pool using a Go `map[types.Hash]*core.Transaction`
- ✅ Efficient deduplication using custom `TxHasher`
- ✅ Timestamp tracking via `firstSeen` field
- ✅ Sorting logic with `TxMapSorter`
- ✅ Verification and addition of new transactions in `Server.handleTransaction`
- ✅ Gob-based encoder and decoder for transactions
- ✅ Unit tests for add/flush and duplicate detection

This setup forms the base of a robust mempool system, and is ready to be expanded with networking, prioritization, and cleanup strategies.

## 🔧 2. TxPool Structure & Logic

The `TxPool` is your project's in-memory transaction pool used to temporarily store valid transactions before they are included in blocks. It is designed for simplicity, deduplication, and efficient lookup.

### 🧬 Internal Structure

```go
type TxPool struct {
	transactions map[types.Hash]*core.Transaction
}
```

- A map is used to store transactions keyed by their hash.
- This allows for O(1) average-time lookups, which is ideal for checking if a transaction is already known.

### 🛠️ Key Methods

**Add(tx *Transaction) error**
- Adds a transaction to the pool.
- Uses the custom TxHasher to compute a unique hash.
- If the transaction already exists, it’s skipped silently (not an error).

```go
func (p *TxPool) Add(tx *core.Transaction) error {
	hash := tx.Hash(core.TxHasher{})
	if p.Has(hash) {
		return nil
	}
	p.transactions[hash] = tx
	return nil
}
```

> 🧠 This is important because in real-world networks, duplicate transactions are common (e.g., rebroadcasted by peers).

**Has(hash types.Hash) bool**
- Checks whether a given transaction (by hash) exists in the pool.

**Flush()**
- Clears the transaction pool by resetting the internal map.
- Useful for tests or block finalization.

**Len() int**
- Returns the number of transactions currently held in the pool.

### 🔐 Deduplication with TxHasher

The TxHasher ensures deterministic transaction hashing by hashing only the transaction data:

```go
func (TxHasher) Hash(tx *Transaction) types.Hash {
	h := sha256.Sum256(tx.Data)
	return types.Hash(h)
}
```

- This allows consistent identification and avoids storing duplicates.
- The TxPool uses this hash as a key in its internal map.


## ⏱️ 3. Transaction Arrival Time

To manage transaction ordering within the mempool, each transaction stores a timestamp representing when it was first seen by the node.

---

### 🕒 Purpose of `firstSeen` Field

The `firstSeen` field in the `Transaction` struct is used to track the **arrival time** of each transaction:

```go
type Transaction struct {
	// ... other fields
	firstSeen int64
}
```

This value helps:
- Maintain fairness in block inclusion (older transactions first)
- Support time-based sorting when creating blocks
- Aid in debugging and performance monitoring

### 🧩 Methods for Managing Arrival Time

**SetFirstSeen(timestamp int64)**

Used to record when the transaction was received by the node.

```go
func (tx *Transaction) SetFirstSeen(timestamp int64) {
	tx.firstSeen = timestamp
}
```

**FirstSeen() int64**

Returns the recorded timestamp.

```go
func (tx *Transaction) FirstSeen() int64 {
	return tx.firstSeen
}
```

### 📊 Why Timestamping Matters
- Mempools often prioritize transactions by arrival time or fee (future enhancement).
- Sorting transactions by time enables predictable block creation behavior.
- Helps avoid starvation of old transactions in busy networks.

This design keeps the mempool simple yet extensible for future enhancements like fee-based ordering or transaction expiry.

## 🗂️ 4. Sorting Transactions

In blockchain systems, transactions in the mempool often need to be **sorted** before inclusion in a block. This allows for fair or prioritized block construction.

---

### 🧱 `TxMapSorter` Implementation

The `TxMapSorter` is a custom Go type that converts the `map[types.Hash]*Transaction` structure into a **slice** of transactions and sorts it by their arrival time (`firstSeen`):

```go
type TxMapSorter struct {
	transactions []*core.Transaction
}
```

It implements Go’s sort.Interface:

```go
func (s *TxMapSorter) Len() int           { return len(s.transactions) }
func (s *TxMapSorter) Swap(i, j int)      { s.transactions[i], s.transactions[j] = s.transactions[j], s.transactions[i] }
func (s *TxMapSorter) Less(i, j int) bool { return s.transactions[i].FirstSeen() < s.transactions[j].FirstSeen() }
```

Usage is encapsulated in a helper:

```go
func NewTxMapSorter(txs map[types.Hash]*core.Transaction) *TxMapSorter {
	txx := make([]*core.Transaction, 0, len(txs))
	for _, tx := range txs {
		txx = append(txx, tx)
	}
	s := &TxMapSorter{transactions: txx}
	sort.Sort(s)
	return s
}
```

### 🕒 Sorted by Arrival Time

Transactions are ordered based on the firstSeen field, ensuring:
- Oldest transactions are considered first
- Consistent behavior for block creation
- Fairness in transaction inclusion


### 📌 When Sorting Is Needed

Sorting becomes essential when:
- Creating a new block: Older transactions should ideally be added first
- Handling limited block size: Helps prioritize by time (or fees, in future)
- Implementing fee markets: Future enhancement could sort by fee-per-byte

Sorting is designed for future scalability while maintaining current simplicity.


## 🧪 5. Testing the TxPool

Testing the transaction pool ensures that it behaves predictably — especially around transaction storage, deduplication, and cleanup. All related tests are located in `txpool_test.go`.

---

### ✅ Unit Tests Covered

#### `TestTxPool`
- Verifies a **newly created pool** is empty:
```go
p := NewTxPool()
assert.Equal(t, p.Len(), 0, "New transaction pool should be empty")
```

**TestTxPoolAddTx**

- Adds a transaction and verifies it’s stored:

```go
tx := core.NewTransaction([]byte("test transaction"))
err := p.Add(tx)
assert.NoError(t, err)
assert.Equal(t, p.Len(), 1)
```

- Adds the same transaction again:

```go
txx := core.NewTransaction([]byte("test transaction"))
err = p.Add(txx)
assert.Nil(t, err)
assert.Equal(t, p.Len(), 1)
```

✔ This confirms that duplicate transactions are not added again thanks to the TxHasher-based Has() check.

---

### 🧹 Flush and Reset
- Flush() is tested to ensure complete clearing of the pool:

```go
p.Flush()
assert.Equal(t, p.Len(), 0)
```

This is crucial for scenarios like:
- Mining a new block and clearing included transactions
- Resetting the mempool after chain reorg or test setup

### 🧪 Summary

| Behavior                 | Tested In            | Ensures                             |
|--------------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Empty pool on init       | `TestTxPool`         | Fresh pool starts clean              |
| Add transaction          | `TestTxPoolAddTx`    | Pool accepts new transactions        |
| Prevent duplicates       | `TestTxPoolAddTx`    | Mempool deduplicates on `Hash`       |
| Flush transactions       | `TestTxPoolAddTx`    | `Flush()` resets internal state      |

## 📥 6. Transaction Handling in Server

The `handleTransaction()` method in `server.go` is responsible for processing incoming transactions before they're considered for inclusion in a block.

### 🧩 Flow of `handleTransaction()`

1. **Verify the Transaction Signature**

   ```go
   if err := tx.Verify(); err != nil {
       return fmt.Errorf("failed to verify transaction: %w", err)
   }
   ```

- Ensures the transaction is signed by a valid key holder.
- Prevents tampered or malicious transactions from being added.

2.	Check for Duplication in the Mempool

    ```go
    hash := tx.Hash(core.TxHasher{})
    if s.memPool.Has(hash) {
        logrus.WithFields(logrus.Fields{
            "hash": hash,
        }).Info("mempool already contains this transaction")
        return nil
    }
    ```
    -  Avoids reprocessing the same transaction multiple times.

3.	Add to Mempool and Log the Event

    ```go
    if err := s.memPool.Add(tx); err != nil {
        return fmt.Errorf("failed to add transaction to mempool: %w", err)
    }

    logrus.WithFields(logrus.Fields{
        "hash": tx.Hash(core.TxHasher{}),
    }).Info("adding new transaction to mempool")
    fmt.Printf("Transaction added to mempool: %s\n", tx.Hash(core.TxHasher{}))
    ```

    - Adds the transaction to the mempool for potential inclusion in a block.
    - Logs the event for auditing and monitoring purposes.

## 🧵 7. Encoding Transactions

To enable network communication or persistent storage, transactions must be serialized into byte streams. In your codebase, this is handled through dedicated encoder and decoder structs using Go's `encoding/gob` package.

---

### 🧱 `GobTxEncoder`

The `GobTxEncoder` is used to encode a `Transaction` into a binary format suitable for transmission or storage.

```go
type GobTxEncoder struct {
	w io.Writer
}

func NewGobTxEncoder(w io.Writer) *GobTxEncoder {
	gob.Register(elliptic.P256())
	return &GobTxEncoder{w: w}
}

func (e *GobTxEncoder) Encode(tx *Transaction) error {
	return gob.NewEncoder(e.w).Encode(tx)
}
```

- It registers the elliptic curve (P256) to allow correct serialization of public keys used in the transaction.
- Takes an io.Writer so it can stream data to files, buffers, or sockets.

### 📥 GobTxDecoder

The GobTxDecoder performs the reverse — decoding byte streams into usable Transaction objects.

```go
type GobTxDecoder struct {
	r io.Reader
}

func NewGobTxDecoder(r io.Reader) *GobTxDecoder {
	gob.Register(elliptic.P256())
	return &GobTxDecoder{r: r}
}

func (d *GobTxDecoder) Decode(tx *Transaction) error {
	return gob.NewDecoder(d.r).Decode(tx)
}
```

- Also registers the elliptic curve, as Go’s gob package requires all concrete types to be known at runtime.
- Supports decoding transactions received over the network or loaded from disk.

### ✅ Why This Matters
- 🔒 Cryptographic Compatibility: Without registering the elliptic curve (P256), gob cannot serialize the ECDSA public keys.
- 🔁 Reusable I/O Abstractions: Encoders/decoders are plug-and-play and can be used across network and storage layers.
- 🧪 Testability: Encoders abstract serialization logic, making unit testing and mocking easier.

# ðŸ§± Guide 5: Generic Encoding, Decoding & Hashing in Blockchainz

This guide explains the transition to a more generic and modular architecture for encoding, decoding, and hashing within the `blockchainz` system. The goal is to decouple logic and support extensibility for future changes like new encoding formats or consensus mechanisms.

## 1. Overview

[Placeholder: Summary of the motivation and goal of this redesign.]

---

## 2. Generic Transaction Design

- Explanation of `Transaction` struct
- Signing using private key
- Test coverage

---

## 3. Block Structure Updates

- New fields: `Validators`, `Signature`, `hash`
- Use of `Hasher` interface
- Generic `Encode()` and `Decode()` functions

---

## 4. Encoder and Decoder Interfaces

- Purpose and definition of `Encoder[T]` and `Decoder[T]`
- How they abstract serialization
- Sample usage pattern (defer implementation detail for now)

---

## 5. Hasher Interface and BlockHasher

- Interface `Hasher[T]`
- `BlockHasher` implementation using `gob` + `sha256`
- Only header is hashed for now

---

## 6. Testing: Signing and Hashing

- Mention tests like `TestSignTransaction`
- Future plan: add test for block encoding and hash verification

---

## 7. Next Steps (TODO)

- Implement `Transaction` encoding/decoding
- Full block serialization (including transactions)
- Validator signature verification
- Custom binary format for efficiency
